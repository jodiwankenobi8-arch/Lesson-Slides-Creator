PERFORMANCE FIRST — STRICT MODE (DO ONLY THIS, NO VISUAL REDESIGN YET)

Goal: stop lag. Do NOT do any aesthetic redesign, spacing tweaks, ribbon styling, or “make it prettier” work. We are freezing visuals until I say otherwise.

0) HARD RULES

Execute ONLY the changes below.

No summaries, audits, reports, or “next steps.”

No popups.

When finished, reply only: Done.

1) TURN OFF VERBOSE LOGGING (BIG WIN)

Ensure logger.debug() does not run in preview/production builds.

Keep logger.error() and logger.warn() only.

Remove any remaining console.* calls (replace with logger or delete).
Goal: reduce console + runtime overhead.

2) AUTOSAVE: SILENT + MUCH LESS FREQUENT

Increase autosave debounce to 10 seconds (from 2s).

Do NOT autosave while the user is actively typing; reset timer on every keystroke.

Only save after 10s of inactivity.

Saving must be silent: no toasts, no modals, no banners.

3) REMOVE/PAUSE ALL BACKGROUND POLLING

Disable any recurring intervals (network checks, job status polling, health pings, etc.) unless the user is actively on a page that needs it.

If polling is needed for a specific page, start it only when that page mounts and stop it on unmount.
Goal: no “always running” timers.

4) PREVENT RENDER THRASHING (MOST IMPORTANT)

Identify and fix components causing frequent re-renders:

wrap stable components with React.memo

use useMemo / useCallback for props passed to children

avoid creating new objects/arrays/functions inline in JSX where it triggers re-renders

Ensure slide preview / thumbnail lists do NOT rerender the whole list on small state changes.

5) VIRTUALIZE / LIMIT HEAVY LISTS

For slide thumbnails / lesson lists:

render only what’s visible (virtualize) OR

cap rendering to first ~20 items and lazy-render the rest on scroll.
Goal: keep DOM small.

6) DEFER HEAVY WORK TO IDLE TIME

Any non-critical heavy work (parsing, indexing, precomputing previews) must run via:

requestIdleCallback (with fallback to setTimeout)

or a Web Worker if already available

Never block the UI thread during navigation/typing.

7) PROOF OUTPUT (REQUIRED)

At the end, paste ONLY:

the exact files changed (file paths)

the updated autosave debounce value and where it’s defined

a list of all active intervals/timers remaining in the app (should be none globally)

Then reply: Done.

STRICT COMPLETION MODE — “DONE” ONLY IF ALL REQUIREMENTS MET

You are not done. Do NOT say “Done” unless every item below is completed and proven.

REQUIRED CHANGES (MUST COMPLETE ALL)
1) DELETE THESE FILES (HARD DELETE)

Delete src/app/components/recovery-prompt.tsx

Delete src/utils/dev-auto-login.ts

2) REMOVE ANY RECOVERY REFERENCES (VERIFY)

Search for these strings and ensure 0 matches:

RecoveryPrompt

getRecoverySnapshot

startAutoRecovery

stopAutoRecovery

restoreFromSnapshot

clearSnapshot

3) THEME ENFORCEMENT = ZERO VIOLATIONS (NOT “MOSTLY”)

Perform a bulk replacement pass across the codebase so ALL disallowed Tailwind color classes are eliminated.

Disallowed patterns must be 0 matches:

bg-gray- text-gray- border-gray-

bg-blue- text-blue- border-blue-

bg-purple- text-purple- border-purple-

indigo orange yellow emerald

Any hard-coded hex colors not in Apple Orchard tokens

Replace with Apple Orchard tokens only: var(--ao-...) or existing semantic vars in theme.css.

PROOF REQUIRED (NO EXCUSES)

At the end, paste ONLY:

Output showing both files are deleted (e.g., git status showing deletions, or directory listing showing they no longer exist)

Search/grep counts showing ALL patterns above are 0 matches

If any matches remain, list remaining files and fix them until 0.

RESPONSE RULE

If and only if everything is complete and proof shows zeros, reply: Done.
Otherwise reply: Not done — still fixing.
